# CapstonePrototype

This project is a gamified 3D modelling experience allowing users to creatively use simple primitives to design more complex figures. The experience is networked, with one player being given the prompt for what they must create, and the other player views a screenshare of the other player's screen, seeing their design in realtime. They must then guess what the player is creating with the shapes.The game is currently being developed for iOS.


Early prototyping is focused on interaction design, namely the issue of having to design in 3D on a smartphone.
